# BigWorld
A demo which features an arbitrarily large world, if you want to make it. As a demo, it doesn't have any particular objective and is fairly small.
<br>Controls:
<ul><li>WASD: move</li><li>Space: hold to shoot, press to talk with NPCs (black circles)</li></ul>
The forests are randomly generated.
